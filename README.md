# SBA_316_DOM
<h1> Lakays News </h1>
<h3> Blog <h3>
My SBA 316 DOM is about a Blog where I'm going to post daily the news and events in the Haitian community.

<h3>How did I Proceed</h3>
I created my html, js and css files to implement my codes and follow the requirements :<br>
_Manipulating the DOM : selecting Elements, create Elements and modify them in the DOM.<br>
_Create a dynamic page to respond to the user interaction by using event listener, input form.<br>
_Communicate with the user to make the experience easier.<br>
_Having an Input form and validate it by putting some restrictions and testing them.<br>


<h3> Issues </h3>
The main Issue I had is to define my functions, calling them and use them properly to have the result expected. I had some issue with the syntax also.
